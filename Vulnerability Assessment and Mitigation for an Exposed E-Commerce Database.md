# Vulnerability Assessment Report
Based on a fictional company, created during Google's Cybersecurity Course.


## System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2023 to August 2023. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA"> NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1</a> is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this risk assessment is to measure the risk that threats pose to the remote database server, an essential business asset. The database server is valuable to the business as it is used to find potential customers across the globe, and is used regularly by employees to access data to generate future business. 

It is important to secure the data on the server, not only from a regulatory standpoint with the likes of PCI-DSS and GDPR for protecting customer data, but also from a business perspective; if the server is compromised, employees can no longer generate future business and there follows the risk of reputational damage, financial loss and overall cost to the business.

## Risk Assessment

| Threat Source | Threat Event                           | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|------------|----------|------|
| Competitor    | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 1          | 3        | 3    |
| Employee      | Alter/Delete critical information      | 2          | 3        | 6    |
| Hacker        | Craft counterfeit certificates        | 2          | 3        | 6    |

## Approach

Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks to day-to-day operational needs.

Given the system is up to date with software, and the hardware requirements are sufficient, the most prevalent threats to the server are of a human nature. Competitors may want to steal customer data to bolster their business information, employees are always a considered threat, whether it is accidental or a purposeful action which would damage the business, and hackers may want to access the server being that it is public facing, and they may gain some monetary value from the available customer information which they could craft counterfeit certificates for to bypass potential security measures in place to look legitimate.

## Remediation Strategy

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing on firewalls to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
