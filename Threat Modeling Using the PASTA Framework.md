| **I. Define business and security objectives** | **Business:** The app should be easy to use for customers, with confidence in data handling and usage. There should be chat and rating functions. Streamlined sales processes with multiple payment options available. <br><br> **Security:** Data security considerations for credit card payments (PCI-DSS) and user/customer data (GDPR). IAM controls should be in place for user accounts for secure logins. Encryption of data at rest, in use, and in transit.  |
| **II. Define the technical scope**          | **List of technologies used by the application:** <br>- Application programming interface (API)<br>- Public key infrastructure (PKI)<br>- SHA-256- SQL <br><br> APIs will be used for the components of the app to interact with one another. PKI is used for both symmetric and asymmetric encryption to encrypt payment sensitive data and exchange keys between the app and devices used. SHA-256 is used for the hashing of sensitive user data and SQL is used for the collation and recall of sneaker and seller information on the app. These technologies combined create aspects of defence in depth, providing a more secure experience for users, protecting their data. |  
| **III. Decompose application**          | ![image](https://github.com/JustA-Byte/Risk-Lab/assets/161458321/8e32fb19-28fc-41fa-8e2a-fb931f51b37a) |
| **IV. Threat Analysis**    | The following are potential risks to the information being handled by the application: <br>- **Internal Threats:** Employees or misconfigured systems<br>- **External Threats:** Threat actors attempting to steal data or infect systems with malware        |
| **V. Vulnerability Analysis** | The following are vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited:<br>- User input fields could be compromised with SQL injection due to the lack of prepared statements<br>- Weak log-in credentials could pose a risk and lead to session hijacking from threat actors |
| **VI. Attack modelling** | ![image](https://github.com/JustA-Byte/Risk-Lab/assets/161458321/ad7c006d-29fa-49d3-b27d-7bdc0377f439) |
| **VII. Risk analysis and impact** | Recommended security controls to mitigate risk and reduce attack surfaces could be as follows: <br>- Implement prepared statements on user input fields to run code before passing to databases <br>- Implement password policies to ensure more complex and secure login credentials are used <br>- Ensure policies are put in place for processes and standards to be enacted for compliance towards PCI-DSS and GDPR <br>- Perform employee awareness training to reduce the risk of social engineering and phishing attacks |
